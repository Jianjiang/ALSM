R Markdown Files for Kutner et al., Applied Linear Statistical Models 5th ed.

Included are all listed figures and tables for which data is provided. Examples that were not stated or indexed in the text were included at my discretion.

For data files, visit author's text site such as https://netfiles.umn.edu/users/nacht001/www/nachtsheim/5th/

These files were in-process to be reorganized and a better way to deliver data+code. However, time has not allowed me to edit these in several months (years?)

NOTE: The code assumes the data is stored in a separate directory adjacent to the directory of Rmd files. Similar to this directory structure

    |--data
    |--|--CH01TA03.txt
    |--|--CH02FI04.txt
    |--Rmd
    |--|--ch01.Rmd
    |--|--ch02.Rmd
