R Markdown Files for Kutner et al., Applied Linear Statistical Models 5th ed.

Included are all listed example figures and tables for which data is provided. Examples that were not stated or so indexed in the text were included at my discretion.

The HTML output can be viewed at my RPubs -- http://rpubs.com/bryangoodrich

Data is provided in an Rda file. For original data files, visit author's text site such as https://netfiles.umn.edu/users/nacht001/www/nachtsheim/5th/

These files were in-process to be reorganized and a better way to deliver data+code. However, time has not allowed me to edit these in several months (years?). Bugs may be present. Please let me know if you find anything. This is a work in progress I may try to continue some day, especially if a 6th edition is ever released! I still have chapters 19 onward to complete. Chapters 13 and 14 are also incomplete, requiring neural networks and other glm families covered, respectively.
